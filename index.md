## about me

I'm Abolfazl Malekpour. I'm a 15-year-old boy living in the city of Tabriz in Iran. I love programming and studying math (in that order üòÅ). I also love chess and chess engines. I'm currently working on my own chess engine in C++, and if I ever complete it, the code should be in my GitHub account. I'm also working on my own deep learning library in Python (you know, like TensorFlow or torch, but way simpler). I have about 12 medals in different international contests and olympiads.
